#RHEL 7 hack pre-reqs
# These are good off the base:
git cpp make autoconf automake libtool patch memcached gcc-c++ cmake wget expat-devel binutils-devel svn elfutils-libelf-devel rpmdevtools yum-utils patch
libmemcached-devel tbb-devel libdwarf-devel mysql-devel libxml2-devel libicu-devel pcre-devel gd-devel sqlite-devel pam-devel libcurl-devel bzip2-devel openldap-devel readline-devel libcap-devel libevent-devel libxslt-devel boost-devel ImageMagick-devel 

# These are not:
##  requires epel repo
libmcrypt-devel
jemalloc-devel

##  requires the optional repo
libc-client-devel
oniguruma-devel

##  needs to be built
glog-devel  (fedora repo has it, epel does not)
